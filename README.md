# Coding Quiz

## Description

This project was used for me to practice my continued learning with Javascript and use local API. It also functions as a quiz to help me review concepts that I can add to as I progress. I learned about some additional functions like setTime and local storage abilities. I had trouble getting the quiz to stop with the timer, but was happy to make as much progress as I did.
